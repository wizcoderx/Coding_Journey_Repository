## Reinforcement

1. Write a short Python function, is_multiple(n, m), that takes two integer values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some integer i, and False (code_one.py)

2. Write a short Python function, is_even(k), that takes an integer value and returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators (code_two.py)

3. Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of one or more numbers and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or max in implementing your solution. (code_three.py)

4. Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n. (code_four.py)

5. Give a single command that computes the sum from Exercise 4, relying on Python’s comprehension syntax and the built-in sum function. (code_five.py)

6. Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all the odd positive integers smaller than n. (code_six.py)

7. Give a single command that computes the sum from Exercise R-1.6, relying on Python’s comprehension syntax and the built-in sum function. (included in code_six.py)

8. Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence, such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used for index -n ≤ k < 0, what is the equivalent index j ≥ 0 such that s[j] references the same element? (code_eight.py)

9. What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a range with values 50, 60, 70, 80? (code_nine.py)

10. What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a range with values 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8? (code_ten.py)

11. Demonstrate how to use Python’s list comprehension syntax to produce the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256].(code_ten.py)

12.  Python’s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a random element from a non-empty sequence. The random module includes a more basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to the built-in range function, that returns a random choice from the given range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version of the choice function. (code_twelve.py)
