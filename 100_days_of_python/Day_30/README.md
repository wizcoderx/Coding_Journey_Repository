<hr>

structure of exceptional handling:
<code>
try --> you'r trying to execute a code, but at some point it work or might not.
except --> If something goes wrong and it was not as expected as you were wish to go.
else --> Do this if there was no exception, like you 'try' this thing which might fail but it succeded without problems.
finally --> Carry out the code no matter what happends
</code>
