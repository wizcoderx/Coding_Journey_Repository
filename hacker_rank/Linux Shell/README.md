## Challenge List
The numbers correspond to the respective code files, e.g., `code_one` for challenge 1, `code_two` for challenge 2, and so on.

1. **Display Odd Natural Numbers**
   Write a script to use a `for` loop to display only odd natural numbers from 1 to 9.

2. **Greet the User**
   Create a Bash script that accepts a `name` as input and displays the greeting:
   `"Welcome (name)"`.

3. **Display Natural Numbers**
   Use a `for` loop to display the natural numbers from 1 to 50.

4. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   Given two integers, X and Y, calculate and display their:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
   - Quotient

5. **Comparison of Two Numbers**
   Given two numbers, X and Y, determine if:
   - `X < Y`
   - `X > Y`
   - `X == Y`

6. **Character Input Check**
   Read a single character from `STDIN`. Based on the input:
   - Display `"YES"` if the character is `Y` or `y`.
   - Display `"NO"` if the character is `N` or `n`.

7. **Triangle Type Determination**
   Create a script to determine if a triangle is:
   - Scalene
   - Equilateral
   - Isosceles

8. **Extract 3rd Character from Input**
   Write a Bash command to process multiple lines of input and print the 3rd character from each line as a new line of output.
   _Note: It is guaranteed that each input line contains at least three characters._

9. **Extract 2nd and 7th Characters**
   Display the 2nd and 7th character from each line of text.

10. **Extract Range of Characters**
    Extract and display a range of characters from a string, starting at position `start` and ending at position `end` (inclusive).

11. **Extract First Four Characters**
    Display the first four characters from each line of text.

12. **Cut-5**
    Given a tab delimited file with several columns (tsv format) print the first three fields

## Usage
Each challenge has a corresponding `.sh` file in the repository. To execute a specific challenge:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the `.sh` files.
2. Use the following format to run the script:

```bash
   bash code_<number in text>.sh
```
