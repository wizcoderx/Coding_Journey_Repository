The image provides a problem description where you need to convert a given time in a 12-hour AM/PM format to a 24-hour (military) time format.

Explanation of the Task:
You are given a string s that represents the time in a 12-hour AM/PM format, such as 12:01:00PM or 12:01:00AM.
The task is to convert this time into a 24-hour time format.
Conversion Rules:
AM and PM conversions:
For AM: If the hour is 12 (i.e., 12:00AM), it should be converted to 00 (midnight).
For PM: If the hour is 12 (i.e., 12:00PM), it remains 12 (noon).
For any other hour, if itâ€™s in AM, it stays the same except for converting the 12-hour format to 24-hour format.
For PM, add 12 to the hour if it's not 12 (for example, 1:00PM becomes 13:00).
