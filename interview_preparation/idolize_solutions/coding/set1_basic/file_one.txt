The chips, called GeForce RTX 50-series, will come pre-installed in computers ranging from about $550 to $2,000, the company said. Laptops with the chips will start shipping in March.
Nvidia unveiled the processors at CES in Las Vegas, where CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote address on Monday.
“Can you imagine, you have this incredible graphics card, Blackwell, I’m going to shrink it and put it in there,” Huang said, holding up a laptop.
