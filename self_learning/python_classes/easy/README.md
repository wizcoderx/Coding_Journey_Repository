Here are five easy Python class questions for you to practice:

1. **Define a Simple Class**
   Create a class called `Dog` that has two attributes: `name` and `age`. Implement a method called `bark` that returns a string saying "Woof! My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

2. **Class with a Method**
   Define a class called `Circle` that has an attribute `radius`. Implement a method called `area` that calculates and returns the area of the circle using the formula: \( \text{area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \).

3. **Class with a Constructor**
   Create a class named `Book` that has attributes for `title`, `author`, and `year_published`. Use the constructor to initialize these attributes. Also, create a method called `description` that returns a string summarizing the book's details.

4. **Inheritance**
   Define a base class called `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `model`. Create a subclass called `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds an attribute `num_doors`. Implement a method in `Car` that returns a string describing the car.

5. **Class with Class and Instance Variables**
   Create a class called `Student` that has an instance variable `name` and a class variable `school_name`. Implement a method that returns a string showing the student's name and their school name. Make sure to show how class variables can be accessed and modified.

Feel free to ask if you need hints or solutions for any of these questions!
