'''
   Update the `Student` class so that each subject in the `grades` dictionary can store multiple grades as a list. Implement a `get_best_subject` method that returns the subject with the highest average grade. Also, add a `print_report_card` method that displays each subjectâ€™s average grade in a structured report format.
