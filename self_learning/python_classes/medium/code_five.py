   Update the `Student` class to have a dictionary attribute `grades`, where keys are subject names and values are grades. Add methods `add_grade(subject, grade)` to add a grade and `average_grade` to calculate the average grade across subjects. Add a class method `change_school_name` to modify the class variable `school_name`.
